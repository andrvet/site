For this project, you work for a foreign aid non-profit delivering shipments of aid to villages and towns s in a war-torn nation. 
Circumstances are not stable on the ground; the sites that the NGO is willing to safely deliver to changes frequently, 
as well as the safe roads available to travel between locations.
 
Your company has asked you to create a new application to help 
keep track of the changing landscape by recording the data on these available sites as they come and go.
 
Your first task: 
- design a RESTful Web Service to be used to record the available sites and their distances between them.
 
Users of the RESTful Web Service you design should be minimally able to
 
+ 1)- Create a new Site
+	-- Sites need only be identified by a Site Name.
	-- Creation can include an optional list of the direct connections to other sites and the associated distance in kilometers (km).
 2)- List details for any site
	-- Return the Site Name, and all direct connections to other sites and the associated distance in kilometers (km).
 3)- Update a Site
+	-- Update the name of a site
	-- Delete, Add, or Update any direct connections that site has to other sites and the associated distances in kilometers (km).
+- Delete a Site
+- List all available sites
 
A set of test data has been attached to this file email, listing sample data that should be inserted into your application before the demo.
 
Your solution must be written in Java 7 or Java 8, and will be judged on good practices and style.
 
Your solution is not required to:
- provably run on any machine outside of your laptop or other demo machine;
- persist data beyond the running java instance
 
Be prepared to:
- Show the project, both code and a running version and perform a simple demo.
	-- If remote, we can provide WebEx or Skype accounts as needed 
- Modify the project during the in-depth interview.
- Explain the design choices in your project, including API design, software organization and modelling, etc.
- Discuss the choice of any open source libraries used in the implementation.
